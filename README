Welcome to SableCC 4!
=====================

This version is a work in progress release. We hope that it will
encourage you to join the team and help develop SableCC 4. You can
participate in various ways: write new code, test existing code,
suggest improvements, etc.

SableCC 4 does not yet generate any code. However, you can use
currently available code as a library for your own programs.  You will
find the library jar file in the lib/ directory, and its API
documentation in the doc/ directory.

About SableCC 4
===============

SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
other text parsers. In particular, generated frameworks include
intuitive strictly-typed abstract syntax trees and tree
walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean separation between
machine-generated code and user-written code which leads to a shorter
development cycle.

SableCC 4 is a complete rewrite of SableCC to bring many new features:

* Improved lexer engine (additional operators, semantic selectors, and
  more).
* Improved parser engine (linear approximate LR(K) parsing, semantic
  selectors, and more).
* Improved conflict reporting (enabling LR grammar debugging).
* Flexible code generation (to enable back-ends for various
  languages).
* Improved syntax for CST->AST transformations.
* And more.
