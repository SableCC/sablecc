About SableCC 4
===============

SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
other text parsers. In particular, generated frameworks include
intuitive strictly-typed abstract syntax trees and tree
walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean separation between
machine-generated code and user-written code which leads to a shorter
development cycle.

SableCC 4 is a complete rewrite of SableCC that brings many new
features:

* Improved lexer engine (additional operators, lookahead, and more).
* Improved parser engine (linear approximate LR(K) parsing, semantic
  selectors, and more).
* Improved conflict reporting (enabling grammar debugging).
* Flexible code generation (to enable back-ends for various
  languages).
* Improved syntax for CST->AST transformations.
