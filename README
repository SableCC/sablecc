Welcome to SableCC 4!
=====================

This version is a work in progress release. We hope that it will
encourage you to join the project and help develop SableCC 4. You can
participate in various ways: write new code, test existing code,
suggest improvements, etc.

SableCC 4 does not yet generate code.  However, you can use its
ObjectMacro component, a text generator which currently supports Java
as a target language.  You can also use SableCC to parse grammars
written using the new syntax.  You will find the executable jar files
in the lib/ directory and the API documentation in the doc/ directory.

About SableCC 4
===============

SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
other text parsers. In particular, generated frameworks include
intuitive strictly-typed abstract syntax trees and tree
walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean separation between
machine-generated code and user-written code which leads to a shorter
development cycle.

SableCC 4 is a complete rewrite of SableCC that brings many new
features:

* Improved lexer engine (additional operators, lookahead, and more).
* Improved parser engine (linear approximate LR(K) parsing, semantic
  selectors, and more).
* Improved conflict reporting (enabling grammar debugging).
* Flexible code generation (to enable back-ends for various
  languages).
* Improved syntax for CST->AST transformations.

SableCC 4 also includes ObjectMacro, a powerful system for generating
text that keeps a clean separation between presentation, structure,
and logic.

What's New in SableCC 4-alpha.5
===============================

 * Implement the ObjectMacro system for flexible and robust code
   generation.
 * Add lookahead handling to finite state automatons.
 * Refactor the alphabet package to remove cryptic generic signatures.
 * Improve launcher package.
 * Improve source documentation.
