Welcome to SableCC 4!
=====================

This beta version of SableCC 4 is able to generate lexers and tokens.
It also includes a stable version of the ObjectMacro system, a text
generator. The lexer specification supports many new operators,
including some purely "lexical" operators: "Look" for looking ahead
beyond the end of a token, and "-" for providing the intuitively
desired subtraction behavior. You will find the executable jar files
of SableCC and ObjectMacro in the lib/ directory.

About SableCC 4
===============

SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
other text parsers. In particular, generated frameworks include
intuitive strictly-typed abstract syntax trees and tree
walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean separation between
machine-generated code and user-written code which leads to a shorter
development cycle.

SableCC 4 is a complete rewrite of SableCC that brings many new
features:

* Improved lexer engine (additional operators, lookahead, and more).
* Improved parser engine (linear approximate LR(K) parsing, semantic
  selectors, and more).
* Improved conflict reporting (enabling grammar debugging).
* Flexible code generation (to enable back-ends for various
  languages).
* Improved syntax for CST->AST transformations.

SableCC 4 also includes ObjectMacro, a powerful system for generating
text that keeps a clean separation between presentation, structure,
and logic.
