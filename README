Welcome to SableCC 4!
=====================

This beta version of SableCC 4 contains a preliminary version of the
lexer, parser, and syntax tree generator. It generates
linear-approximate LALR(K) parsers and supports safe priority
specification for disambiguating expressions (i.e. left and right
recursive productions). You will find the executable jar files of
SableCC and ObjectMacro in the lib/ directory.

About SableCC 4
===============

SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
other text parsers. In particular, generated frameworks include
intuitive strictly-typed abstract syntax trees and tree
walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean separation between
machine-generated code and user-written code which leads to a shorter
development cycle.

SableCC 4 is a complete rewrite of SableCC that brings many new
features:

* Improved lexer engine (additional operators, lookahead, and more).
* Improved parser engine (linear approximate LR(K) parsing, semantic
  selectors, and more).
* Improved conflict reporting (enabling grammar debugging).
* Flexible code generation (to enable back-ends for various
  languages).
* Improved syntax for CST->AST transformations.

SableCC 4 also includes ObjectMacro, a powerful system for generating
text that keeps a clean separation between presentation, structure,
and logic.
