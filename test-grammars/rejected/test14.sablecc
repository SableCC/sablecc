Grammar test14:

Lexer
  x = 'x';
  y = 'y';

Parser
  p = x q*;
  q = y r;
  r = x;

// implicit Root p;

Transformation
  Production
    q -> q;
    r -> x;

// implicit p -> p;

  Alternative
    p -> New p(List(q...));
    q -> New q(y r.x);
    r -> x;

// rejected because q was explicitly transformed and cannot appear
// without an element in New p(); it must appear with an element
// as in q.q...

Tree
  p = q*;
  q = y x;
