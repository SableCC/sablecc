Grammar test10:

Lexer
  x = 'x';
  y = 'y';

Parser
  p = x q;
  q = y;

// implicit Root p;

Transformation

// implicit p -> p;
// implicit q -> q;

  Alternative
    p -> New p(q x);

// rejected because elements cannot be reordered
// so x must appear before q in New p()

Tree
  p = q x;
  q = y;
