Grammar test14:

Lexer
  x = 'x';
  y = 'y';

Parser
  p = x q;
  q = y r;
  r = x;

// implicit Root p;

Transformation
  Production
    q -> [yx:](y x)^1;
    r -> [xyx:](x Separator y)^1;

// implicit p -> p;

  Alternative
    p -> New p(List(x q.yx...));
    q -> List(y r.xyx...);
    r -> List(x);

Tree
  p = (x Separator y)^2;
